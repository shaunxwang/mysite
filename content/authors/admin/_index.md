I’m a miner, interpreter and modeller of large data. A father of three lovely kids and a husband to a beautiful wife.

I’m grateful that I have met many people in a professional career as a [data wrangler](#experience). [Andrew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewwcarlton/), [Gina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginahamblett/), [Robert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-panozzo-customerexper/), [Phil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiphoran/),[Stephanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/st%C3%A9phanie-gauthier-b5024618/) and many more who had pushed, nurtured and supported me along the way. A journey of five years seems long, but it’s felt like it’s just begun, there are so many things to learn in this vast and ever-expanding universe of data and computer science. The memory of exhilarating excitements are still vivid in front me when I discovered [VBA](#skills) in Excel and Access, and the endless possibilities of automation; relational database and [SQL](#skills), then NoSQL!; open source and [Linux](#skills); [generalised linear model](#skills) and its matrix algebra; realised 4 units maths was actually useful in deriving moments of a distribution, [principle components](#skiils), maximum likelihood estimators and proving law of large numbers; 80-20 rule was really referring to the area-under-the-curve of a Pareto distribution; observed [normal distribution](#skills) was too “normal” in practice that any population could be merely summaries by mean and (very) occasionally standard deviation, come on! But those frequentist buzz words are trivial compared to what Bayesian and iterative process have brought me – a whole wild world of [non-parametric modelling](#skills): neural nets, KNN, k-means, SVM and random forest.

The latest discovery on this journey is [Python](#posts). It has truly democratised my work with data. One simply can’t resist its open-sourced charm and welcoming communities but to embrace it with open arms. It’s extremely fulfilling when complex business problems are analysed very quickly and well presented/documented in a Jupyter notebook with [data visualisations](#skills); it's rewarding when my functions and modules are adopted by others in the team; and it's satisfying when a better way of doing things is learnt with Python.

This universe of data science is too big to be journeyed alone, I welcome you to join me and walk it step by step, grow day by day.
